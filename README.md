## CRITICAL: Battery Type Configuration

**Modern batteries need DIFFERENT voltages than old batteries!**

This project includes **TWO configurations**:

1. **Lead-Calcium (Ca/Ca)** - Modern batteries (2010+)
   - Uses **15.2V** for charging
   - Default configuration
   - Most automotive batteries since 2010

2. **Lead-Antimony (Sb)** - Legacy batteries (pre-2010)
   - Uses **14.4V** for charging
   - Separate configuration file
   - Older serviceable batteries

### How to Check Your Battery

**Quick check:** When was your battery manufactured?
- **2010 or later** → Use default config (lead-calcium)
- **Before 2010** → Use `charging_config_lead_antimony.yaml`

**Label check:** Look for these markings:
- "Calcium", "Ca/Ca", "Maintenance Free" → Lead-calcium (15.2V)
- "Sb", "Antimony", removable caps → Lead-antimony (14.4V)

**Full guide:** See [docs/BATTERY_TYPES.md](docs/BATTERY_TYPES.md) for detailed identification

### Why This Matters

Using wrong voltages:
- **14.4V on lead-calcium** → Battery never fully charges → premature failure
- **15.2V on lead-antimony** → Excessive gassing → water loss

**Most "dead" batteries just need the correct charging voltage!**

### Configuration Files

```bash
# Modern lead-calcium battery (DEFAULT)
config/charging_config.yaml                    # 15.2V charging

# Legacy lead-antimony battery
config/charging_config_lead_antimony.yaml      # 14.4V charging

# To use legacy config:
python3 src/charger_main.py --config config/charging_config_lead_antimony.yaml
```

## Charging Modes

### IUoU (3-Stage) - Recommended for Most Cases
- Bulk: Constant current (C/10) until absorption voltage
- Absorption: Hold absorption voltage until current tapers
- Float: Maintain 13.5V (reduced from 13.8V to prevent grid corrosion)
- Automatic transitions between stages

### CC (Constant Current) - Traditional 150-Year Method
- Pure constant current charging (C/10 rate)
- Best for open flooded batteries
- Uses voltage plateau detection for auto-stop
- Battery naturally reaches 17-17.5V when full

### Conditioning (Tom's Method) - Advanced Maintenance
- Extended high-voltage (15.4-15.6V) for 24-48 hours
- For batteries that won't hold charge properly
- Improves resting voltage and charge retention
- Includes electrolysis detection
- Better than continuous float for storage batteries

### CV (Constant Voltage)
- Hold target voltage, current tapers naturally
- Good for maintenance charging

### Pulse
- Desulfation mode for neglected batteries
- Voltage pulses with rest periods
- For recovery of sulfated batteries

### Trickle
- Low current maintenance
- Now uses 13.5V (reduced from 13.8V)
- For long-term storage

## Troubleshooting

### Service won't start

```bash
# Check status
sudo systemctl status battery-charger

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u battery-charger -n 50

# Run manually to see errors
cd ~/battery-charger
python3 src/charger_main.py
```

### OWON not found

```bash
# Check USB device
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0

# Check permissions
sudo usermod -a -G dialout pi
# Log out and back in

# Test SCPI
python3 /tmp/test_owon.py
```

### MQTT not working

```bash
# Check mosquitto running
sudo systemctl status mosquitto

# Test manually
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "test" -m "hello"
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "test"
```
