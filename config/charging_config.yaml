# Battery Charger Configuration - LEAD-CALCIUM BATTERIES (Modern, 2010+)
# OWON SPE6205 (60V 20A Power Supply)
#
# IMPORTANT: This configuration is for MODERN lead-calcium batteries!
# Lead-calcium batteries require HIGHER voltages than old lead-antimony batteries.
# Using too-low voltages (14.4V) on lead-calcium batteries causes:
#   - Incomplete charging
#   - Sulfation
#   - Premature failure

# How to identify lead-calcium battery:
#   - Manufactured 2010 or later
#   - Label says "Calcium" or "Ca/Ca"
#   - Label says "Maintenance Free"
#   - Standard in all modern vehicles since ~2010

# Charging Configuration
charging:
  # Default charging mode: IUoU, CV, Pulse, Trickle
  default_mode: "IUoU"

  # IUoU (3-Stage) Mode Configuration - LEAD-CALCIUM OPTIMIZED
  IUoU:
    bulk_current: 9.5             # A - 0.1C for 95Ah (C/10 rate, good balance)
                                   # SPE6205 can deliver up to 20A
                                   # C/10 (9.5A) is standard charging rate
                                   # Use 4.75A for slower/gentler charge

    # CRITICAL: Lead-calcium needs 15-15.4V for full charge!
    absorption_voltage: 15.2      # V - Proper voltage for lead-calcium
                                   # (vs 14.4V for old lead-antimony)

    # Float voltage for maintenance charging
    # WARNING: Continuous 13.8V causes grid corrosion (failure in 1.5 years)
    # For daily-driven vehicles: Disable float (alternator maintains charge)
    # For storage: Use 13.5V or periodic conditioning (15.5V for 24h monthly)
    float_voltage: 13.5           # V - Reduced to prevent grid corrosion (was 13.8V)

    absorption_current_threshold: 1.0  # A - Switch to float when current drops below this
    absorption_timeout: 7200      # seconds (2 hours max in absorption)
    enable_float: true            # Enable float stage

  # IUoU Deep Discharge Recovery Mode (for batteries < 50% charge)
  # Lead-calcium batteries develop acid stratification when deeply discharged
  IUoU_Recovery:
    bulk_current: 9.5             # A - Same as normal IUoU (C/10 rate)
    absorption_voltage: 15.4      # V - HIGHER voltage to break stratification
    absorption_duration: 10800    # seconds (3 hours) - Extended absorption
    float_voltage: 13.5           # V - Reduced to prevent grid corrosion (was 13.8V)
    absorption_current_threshold: 0.8  # A - Lower threshold (more complete charge)
    enable_float: true

  # Constant Voltage Mode Configuration - LEAD-CALCIUM
  CV:
    voltage: 15.0                 # V - Proper CV voltage for lead-calcium
                                   # (vs 13.8V for old lead-antimony)
    max_current: 9.5              # A - Current limit (C/10 rate)
    min_current: 0.5              # A - Consider charged when below this

  # Pulse Charging Mode Configuration (Desulfation)
  # Lead-calcium can handle higher voltages without excessive gassing
  Pulse:
    pulse_voltage: 16.0           # V - Pulse voltage (safe for lead-calcium)
                                   # Note: Lead-calcium gassing voltage is 15.8V
                                   # Brief pulses to 16V are acceptable
    pulse_current: 9.5            # A - Pulse current (C/10 rate)
                                   # SPE6205 can deliver up to 20A
    rest_voltage: 13.5            # V - Rest voltage
    pulse_duration: 20            # seconds - Shorter pulses (safer)
    rest_duration: 40             # seconds - Longer rest
    max_cycles: 30                # More cycles at lower pulse voltage

  # Pure Constant Current Mode - Traditional 150-year method for open batteries
  # "Die Stromladung ist die schnellste und sicherste Methode"
  CC:
    current: 9.5                  # A - Constant current (C/10 = 10% of capacity)
    max_voltage: 18.0             # V - Safety limit only (won't regulate at this)
                                  # Battery naturally reaches 17-17.5V (new) or 16V (older)
                                  # Plateau detection determines completion

  # Conditioning Mode - Tom's Extended High-Voltage Method
  # For batteries that won't hold charge properly
  # Results: Resting voltage 12.6V → 13.3V after 24-48h at 15.4-15.6V
  Conditioning:
    voltage: 15.5                 # V - Conditioning voltage (15.4-15.6V range)

    duration: 86400               # seconds (24 hours) - can extend to 48h
    electrolysis_warning: 1.0     # A - Warn if current > this after 1 hour (water loss)

  # Trickle Charge Mode Configuration
  Trickle:
    # WARNING: Continuous 13.8V causes grid corrosion
    # Use 13.5V max or periodic conditioning (15.5V for 24h) instead
    voltage: 13.5                 # V - Maintenance voltage (reduced from 13.8V)
    current: 0.5                  # A - Very low current
